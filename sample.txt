TELEPROMPTER SAMPLE TEXT

This is a sample text file to demonstrate the teleprompter functionality. You can load your own .txt files to use with this application.

The text will automatically scroll at the speed you set. You can control the teleprompter using either the on-screen buttons or a connected Bluetooth keyboard.

Use the space bar to play or pause the scrolling.

Use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the scrolling speed.

This teleprompter is designed to work well on older iPad models while still providing the core functionality needed for presentations, speeches, or video recordings.

The red line in the middle of the screen indicates the current reading position. Try to keep your eyes focused on this line for the most natural reading pace.

You can format your text files with empty lines between paragraphs for better readability.

For best results, load text files that are not too large and close other applications to ensure smooth performance.

Thank you for using this teleprompter application!
